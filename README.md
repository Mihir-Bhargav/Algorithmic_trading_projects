📈 Algorithmic Trading Projects
This repository contains a major portion of my algorithmic trading work.
From simple SMA crossover strategies to reinforcement-learning-enhanced Black-Scholes models with GBM and Monte Carlo simulations — it’s all here.
This is an ongoing, evolving project. I frequently develop new methods and trading ideas, applying concepts from mathematics, finance, machine learning, and practical market behavior to improve performance.
